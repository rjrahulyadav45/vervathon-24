## A Brief of the Prototype:
  "JAYA"  is an AI Assistance solution designed by our team "RJ CODE HUB" to automate tasks, boost productivity, and enhance user experience working similarly to "Siri" , but specifically for Windows PCs. And we are planning to implement this to build a AI Robot.  It uses advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) to engage in natural conversations, handling tasks like answering queries, managing schedules, and providing personalized recommendations. The AI operates 24/7, learning from user interactions to become smarter over time.

Powered by Python programming  and other high level programming, "JAYA" can serve as a virtual assistant for businesses or a personal assistant for individuals, automating tasks and improving efficiency, just like Siri on a PC platform
